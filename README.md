# Python-Arithmetic-Formatter-Project
Python Project That Contains Project Coding Files Related to Arithmetic Formatter Project


The Arithmetic Formatter is a Python project that formats a list of simple arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) vertically and side-by-side, mimicking the layout typically used in elementary school arithmetic.

This project includes a function arithmetic_arranger() which takes a list of arithmetic problems and returns a string containing the problems arranged in a clean, readable format. It also has an optional parameter to display the answers.


Accepts up to 5 arithmetic problems (addition or subtraction).

Validates inputs:

Only supports + and - operators.

Operands must contain only digits.

Each operand must be no more than four digits.

Aligns numbers to the right for proper formatting.

Optionally displays results of the arithmetic operations.
